# AidansDevsite

Welcome to my Devsite!

This is my development website where I'll be having fun with React and ASP.NET Core.
This website will likely take the form of a personal portfolio of cool stuff that I've done and will give me a chance to play around
with some of the cool features that React and ASP.NET Core have to offer.

What I currenlty want to learn from creating this website is more about the following:
- ASP.NET Core
- Entity framework
- React
- AWS CI/CD pipeline
- Best practices for writing Tests

I hope that I can produce some educational content on this website too and perhaps share some of the experiences I have had on my
journey as a software developer.

If you have any advice by all means please let me know, I'm always looking to learn more.

Thanks for visiting the repo!

Kind Regards,

AidanTheDeveloper
